                Long time ago, Barangay Ambiong was part of a vast land in La Trinidad
                . However, it got noi name during thoise times until settlers form Kabayan,
                Ambaurayan, Ampusongan and Kibungan of Benguet came. Majority of the natives
                who settled in the area were the Ibalois and Kankanaeys. The term Ambiong originally
                came from the ibaloi word "AMBIONGAN" which generally means "BLACK CARPET BEES". 
                These bees were often found in the rolling hills and forests where wild flowers
                and the thick foliage used to abound. They also make their shelters by drilling 
                through the trunk of dead trees. Ambiong was predominantly a thick lush, rich flora, and 
                fauna up until the 1960s. For a long time, befiore the modern era, the area was purposely
                for hunting and food gathering activities.
